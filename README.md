## Summary

Senior Data & AI Engineer with experience designing and deploying large-scale data pipelines, LLM infrastructure, and cloud-native analytics systems. Work spans distributed processing (Spark, PySpark), data platforms (Snowflake, AWS), orchestration (Airflow, dbt), and retrieval systems (LangGraph, LangChain, Milvus/pgvector, rerankers).

Focus areas include:
- Event-driven ELT/ETL pipelines with metadata-rich lakehouse layers  
- Vector search, hybrid retrieval, embedding optimization  
- RAG/LLM system design with observability and performance constraints  
- Containerized workloads on ECS/Fargate with IaC (Terraform)  
- Cost-optimized Snowflake architectures and dbt testing frameworks

## Selected Projects

### **ASTRA-X Overthinker — Autonomous Task Refinement Engine**  
Repo: https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/ASTRA-X-Overthinker-v2
Flask + APScheduler engine that iteratively refines Markdown-based goals using an LLM persona, maintains per-goal journals, appends timestamped progress, and runs on a Dockerized scheduler.
(Architecture and implementation details are intentionally locked due to IPR reservations, repository is private and access-restricted.)

### **Pepper — Portfolio LLM Assistant Backend**  
Repo: https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/Pepper_portfolio  
FastAPI backend for a locked-down “Pepper” assistant that ingests curated LinkedIn/GitHub/site text, builds scoped chat contexts, calls OpenAI, and enforces strict guardrails for your public portfolio.
(Architecture and implementation details are intentionally locked due to IPR reservations, repository is private and access-restricted.)

### **GPT-2 Fine-Tuning — Domain Adaptation Pipeline**  
Repo: https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/GPT-2-Fine-Tuning  
End-to-end GPT-2 fine-tuning workflow using HuggingFace Transformers, including dataset tokenization, training loops, perplexity evaluation, and training curve visualization on custom corpora.

### **Topic-Aware Sentiment Analytics — App Review Intelligence**  
Repo: https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/Topic-Aware-Sentiment-Analysis  
Python pipeline that ingests mobile app reviews, cleans text, runs VADER sentiment analysis, tags reviews by UX topics (interface, performance, etc.), and generates per-topic word clouds and metrics.

### **Blog Sentiment & Subjectivity Analytics — Long-Form Text Mining**  
Repo: https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/Blog-Sentiment-Subjectivity-Analysis  
Text analytics on 50K+ blog posts with cleaning, age-group bucketing, TextBlob polarity/subjectivity scoring, and visualization of sentiment distributions across demographics.

### **Image Classification (ResNet-18) — Transfer Learning Sandbox**  
Repo: https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/ImageClassfication-ResNet18  
PyTorch-based transfer learning script that loads a pre-trained ResNet-18, runs inference on local images, and returns top-k ImageNet class predictions as a template for vision experiments.

### **SynthScoreNet — Synthetic Credit Scoring with GANs**  
Repo: https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/SynthScoreNet  
GAN-driven pipeline that generates synthetic credit profiles for thin-file borrowers and trains a downstream model to predict custom credit scores from the augmented dataset.

### **Login Events ETL — Secure Authentication Log Pipeline**  
Repo: https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/Login-Events-ETL  
Python ETL that reads login events from an AWS SQS queue (via LocalStack), pseudonymizes sensitive fields with SHA-256 hashing, and loads normalized records into a Postgres `user_logins` table.

### **Stock Data Analysis Tool — Multi-API Equity Analytics**  
Repo: https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/stock-data-analysis-tool  
Toolkit that calls multiple financial data APIs, computes growth and valuation metrics (EPS, revenue, cash flow, margins), and surfaces comparative signals for equity screening.

### **Alternative Data Credit Default Risk Model — Home Credit**  
Repo: https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/Alternative-Data-Credit-Default-Risk-Model  
End-to-end ML pipeline on the Home Credit dataset with heavy feature engineering, SMOTE for extreme class imbalance, model selection, and explainability plots for default risk drivers.

### **Insurance Claim Risk Model — Telematics + Policy Features**  
Repo: https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/Insurance-Management-System  
Machine-learning system using synthetic driver telematics and policy attributes to predict claim likelihood, tackling imbalance, leakage prevention, and production-style model evaluation.

### **COVID Trend Analytics — Forecasting & Dashboards**  
Repo: https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/COVID-Trend-Analysis  
Unified US COVID cases, deaths, vaccinations, and hospital capacity into a weekly state-level mart and national time series, then built ARIMA-based forecasts and comparative visualizations.

### **Urban Geospatial Analytics — Venue & Infrastructure Clustering**  
Repo: https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/Urban-Geospatial-Analytics  
Jupyter notebook suite that combines open city data with the Foursquare Places API to analyze venue distributions, cluster neighborhoods, and compare urban infrastructure across cities.

### **GeoSpatial Climate Analytics — GHG Emissions Explorer**  
Repo: https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/GeoSpatial-Climate-Analytics  
R-based pipeline (dplyr + ggplot2) for wrangling UNFCCC GHG data, building country-level emissions profiles, and visualizing long-term climate trends.

### **Forest Fire Estimation — Burn Area Regression**  
Repo: https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/Forest-Fire-Estimation  
Regression modeling of Portuguese forest fires using meteorological variables and Fire Weather Index components to predict log-scaled burned area while handling skewness and outliers.
